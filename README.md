## Best SFW Game of the Year

‘Best SFW Game of the Year’ is a script written in Python to Kaggle database to determine what is the best game of the year.

## Motivation

This project was done by Cristian Alberch in May 2019 as part of the Udacity “Data Scientist” Nanodegree, Term 2, Project 1: Write A Data Science Blog Post.

As a videogame fan, I was looking for good video games to play, even if it is a few years old. I also wanted to explore the evolution of gaming in the last 20 years.

The top 10 results were limited to “Safe For Work” (SFW) videogames. Some of the content on Mature “M” rated videogames includes eye-watering violence and did not want to further promote this material on the internet.

The following are explored:

1. Top rated games by critics and users
2. Top rated games by year using the following metrics:
	-	Critics rating
	-	Users rating
	-	Global sales
3. Evolution of global sales during the last 20 years accoding to:
	- Game Age rating
	- Genre
